# Capstone across a config tree

Make these exact changes:

1. In `nvim.lua`, set `tabstop` and `shiftwidth` to 4.
2. In `services.toml`, change both `old.internal` hosts to `edge.internal`.
3. In `aliases.yaml`, change all three `kubectl` commands to `k` without changing alias names.
4. In `README.md`, change the status from `migration pending` to `migration complete`.

Practice: `<leader>fF` finds files from the challenge worktree, `<leader>sg` searches text from the project root,
`<leader>H` adds the current file to Harpoon, `<leader>h` opens its menu, and
`<leader>1` through `<leader>9` select entries. Native `:e`, `:b`, `<C-o>`, and the alternate-file mapping `<leader>bb`
are also idiomatic.

Golf target: use a picker or Harpoon for cross-file travel, search plus repeat for each repeated edit, and no mouse.

| Keys             | Action                                         |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `<leader>fF`     | find files from the current working directory  |
| `<leader>sg`     | live-grep text across the project root         |
| `<leader>H`      | add the current file to Harpoon                |
| `<leader>h`      | open the Harpoon menu                          |
| `<leader>1`..`9` | jump to that Harpoon slot                      |
| `<leader>bb`     | switch to the alternate (previous) buffer      |
| `<C-o>`          | back through the jump list, works across files |
| `cgn` + `.`      | change the next search match, then repeat      |
