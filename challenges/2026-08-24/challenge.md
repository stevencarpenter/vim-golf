# Make one edit repeatable

Turn the first six feature flags on. Leave `dangerous_cleanup` off. Then duplicate the final
`telemetry_sample_rate` line twice so it appears three times.

Practice: counts, `c`, `.`, `yy`, `2p`, and `6G`. Search once and repeat the same change rather than retyping it. Your
`c` mapping discards replaced text, so the new value remains safe to repeat.

Golf target: type `true` once and use a count for the duplicated lines.
